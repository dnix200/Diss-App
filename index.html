		<h1>Historic Glasgow</h1>
		<p><strong>Historic Glasgow</strong> is a celebration of Glasgow's rich local history and heritage, inviting you to discover the city's wide and varied history, from its Dark Age roots to the Medieval City, from the Merchants' City to the legacy of the Victorian period and beyond.</p>
		<p>The city’s historical legacy is held in many different places; museums and art galleries, libraries and archives, historic buildings, parks and gardens, rivers and canals from its archaeology to its architecture. Glasgow is a vibrant and cosmopolitan place with a wealth of cultural heritage to explore.</p>

		<p>Discover the vibrant history of the city and explore its past through the key themes of the city's history:</p>
		<h3>Medieval City</h3>
		<img src="img/medieval-city.jpeg">
		<p>The beginnings of medieval Glasgow start around 1119 with the building of the Cathedral on the site of St Kentigern’s first church, the patron saint of Glasgow.</p>
		<p>
		Medieval Glasgow ran from the river Clyde, up through the Saltmarket, along High Street and up to the Cathedral.  Recent development of the High Street area has led to archaeological excavation, which has uncovered many hidden gems, giving us a better understanding of Glasgow as a medieval burgh.
		</p>
		<p>
		The medieval landscape of buildings such as the Bishop's Castle, the Auld Pedagogy, the Black and Greyfriars and the Old College, which dominated the medieval High Street for hundreds of years, now lie hidden beneath Glasgow’s Victorian architecture and new developments. Although gone, look around and you'll still see references to the city's history, whether it's the "Old College Bar" or "Blackfriars" free house.
		</p>
		<p>
		However the city’s remaining medieval architecture, such as Glasgow Cathedral, Crookston Castle, Provand's Lordship, Provan Hall, the Trongate and Tolbooth Steeple can be still be visited today.
			
		</p>
		<p>
		Glasgow's coat of arms also has medieval and earlier roots with the fish and the bird appearing in the 13th century and all of the symbols first appearing together in the 15th century. Intertwined closely with St Mungo, the city's patron saint, read about the story of Glasgow’s coat of arms.

		</p>
		<h4>Built Heritage</h4>
		<p>Glasgow is one of the United Kingdom’s most important historic cities with many listed buildings by architects of world renown. </p>
		<p>Much of Glasgow’s past and its present are expressed in these exceptional buildings, many of which are listed and protected
		The celebrated author and spy Daniel Defoe (1660-1731) described Glasgow in glowing terms:</p>
		<p style="text-align: center;"><em>“The four principal streets are the fairest for breadth and the finest built that I have ever seen in one city together. With the exception of London, ‘tis the cleanest and beautifullest and best built city in Britain”.</em></p>

		<h4>Historic Landscapes</h4>
		<img src="img/historic-landscapes.jpeg">
		<p>The name Glasgow is thought to derive from the Brythonic Celtic “Cleschi” meaning “Dear Green Place”.  The city is located on the broad valley floor of the River Clyde. There are hills to the north, north-west and south which provide a backdrop and interesting views.</p>
		<p>
		The River Clyde bisects the city from east to west. Its tributary the River Kelvin is locally important in the north – west as is the White Cart in the south-west. The topography is generally low lying except where there are drumlins. These small hills, of which there are approximately 180, were formed as a result of glacial activity.</p>
		<p>
		Many have been built on and, not surprisingly, they form many of the city’s landmarks. Garnethill, Park Circus, Partickhill, and Blythswood are important examples north of the</p>

		<p>river as are Queen’s Park and Mount Florida to the south. The drumlins have a significantly influenced the alignment of roads and railways.
		</p>
		<p>
		The city originally grew from an ecclesiastic settlement on the banks of the Molendinar Burn spreading down the High St towards the River Clyde.</p>
		<p>
		As Glasgow grew rapidly during the Industrial Revolution, this resulted in high density living environments which took their toll on the health of the city’s inhabitants. As a result the city fathers and wealthy residents focused their attention on City improvements. Extensive parks and boulevards were laid out and public squares and communal gardens were incorporated in redevelopment and expansion schemes. Private gardens and institutional grounds were extensively landscaped and focal points and sculptural features were located throughout the city. The majority of the mature trees within the city were planted during this era.</p>
		<p>
		The city’s historic Landscape also encompasses several large Necropolises, the rural setting on the urban fringe which includes the Antonine Wall running along the city’s northern boundary; several historic sports grounds such as Hampden, Ibrox and Parkhead and also the Forth and Clyde Canal.</p>
		<p>
		Trees and woodlands form an important part of the city’s historic landscape. The trees have born witness to a large number of significant events within the city’s history. If you want to know more, Fossil Grove is an example of the survival of some of Glasgow's ancient trees in fossil form.</p>
		<p>
		Glasgow's Geological Landscape is diverse and mining for substances such as coal, iron and lead was widespread in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Collieries included Cardowan Colliery, formerly in Stepps.</p>
		<p>
		Glasgow's landscapes have impacted on the city's history and vice versa. Many of these diverse environments can be enjoyed all year round by following many of Glasgow's Heritage Trails and alternative routes including many that acknowledge the city's natural heritage.
